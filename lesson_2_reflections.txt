What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Initialization creates a .git directory which is used to track files in the 
repository. This needs to be done to done beacuse you need to explicitly state
what will be a repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and repository? What
value do you think it offers?

The staging area differs as it is a middle ground between the working dir and
the repository.  The value seems to lie in the workflow. Only placing
the desired files in the staging area and not commiting right away, puts a lot
of control on when and what to commit.  Akin to any other staging area.
